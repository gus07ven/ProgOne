I can still remember, at the end of that year, we sat for the last time in our circle together.
She played us her favorite song, "like a bridge over troubled water" 
and quietly passed out a gift she had made for each of us.  
She had made each of us a pottery heart with our name and the date on it on the back each read 
"I believe in ME".We all cried including her.  
She told us she would always remember US.  We believed she would.
